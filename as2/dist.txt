PART A
2 characters past the end of a token. We can illustrate this by using
the longest possible path in the DFA. Supposed we took the route 1->5->6->7, 
it will be able to decide what the token is by the next character: the token
either ends in state 5 or state 8. 

PART B
Consider expression 5e-. Lex will have to examine 3 characters, whereupon the
next character will decide the accepting state. Suppose this next character
is not a digit, then the accepting state cannot be 8, and therefore we end up 
with tokens 5 (accepted by state 5), e (accepted by state 2) and - (accepted 
by state 4). From this, our input file could be: 5e-x.
