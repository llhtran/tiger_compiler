ASSIGNMENT REPORT
- Handling comments: I created a separate state for handling comments. to get
to the COMMENT state, one must be in an INITIAL state. Nested comments were 
dealt with by maintaining a global variable "comm" to keep track of how many
levels the comments are nested.
- Handling strings: Easily the hardest part of the assignment. To get to the
STRING state one must be in an INITIAL state. From STRING, one can get to the
ESCAPE and CONTROL states, which were created to handling escape characters and
control characters accordingly. Escape characters prompt the DFA to enter 
the ESCAPE state from the STRING state, whereby the action will be to 
concatenate the string with appropriate characters that were escaped. Control
characters were dealt with separately through a CONTROL state as well, with an
accompanying function that serves to convert the control character, get their
values, and make sure that they were valid. 
- Error handling: Error handling arises when there are unterminated strings, 
comments, invalid control codes, invalid ASCII character being escaped, 
invalid characters being used. There isn't really a systematic approach to 
handling errors in this program--they were more a side effect of the 
programming process and were added as more functionalities were implemented. 
- End-of-file handling: The only catch is to make sure that there are no 
unterminated strings or comments. This is done by adding a global bool to make
sure the state of the automata must be INITIAL at the end of file.
