- Once again, the documentation in the manual and the book was 
incredibly lacking. It was not so much using the language, but 
actually covering all the grammatical features given the documentation
that was particularly challenging. This homework was a great test of
patience and endurance. 
- I built the program from the bottom up and unit tested them as I
went so I never had more than 50 conflicts at a time, which wasg good.
- Operators were pretty straightforward. I resolved conflicts with 
precedence specification.
- Declarations I pretty much took from the book, and they worked well. 
- More complex structure like LET IN END or FOR DO WHILE DO gave me a
few conflicts that I resolved by adding precedence to some keywords. I am 
still a little hesitant about some of the approaches, because they worked
but may not be airtight. I might go to office hours to ask about this later. 
- The hardest thing to do was handling lvalues. Not because the task was 
particularly challenging, but I could not eliminate my sole shift/reduce 
conflict in this homework despite hours spent debugging and trying to come
up with solutions. It isn't harmful, but I'd still like to get it out of 
my sight. The explanation for this conflict I wrote as a comment in the 
tiger.grm file.
- I am submitting my tiger.grm file with my tiger.lex. I built my parser 
using the one given to the class by Professor Shao, but after I was done I
switched to my own lexer and it seems to work just fine. Hopefully it will
continue to work when it is being graded, because I do like the idea of 
building my own lexer from A-Z. It feels much more adventurous this way!
